This version is based on the idea described in the CSAPP
Implementation Details
0. Possible Maximum allocate size: (2^32 - 1) Bytes
1. Free Block Organization: use implict free list
2. Coalescing: use immediate coalescing with boundary tags
3. Placement: first-fit
4. Splitting: Splitting only if the size of the reminder would equal or exceed the minimum block size
5. Structure: [1 word padding | 2 words Prologue block | block 0 | ... | block n | 1 word Epilogue block]
6. Basic Size Unit
   - 1 word =  4 bytes
   - d-word = 8 bytes
   - aligment = 8 bytes
   - chunksize = 4 KB, aligned with page-size
7. Block
   - Minimum block size: 8 bytes
   - Block size is multiple of 8
   - Allocated Block Structure: [ 1 word header | payload | [optional padding] ]
   - Free Block Structure: [ 1 word header | empty payload | 1 word footer ]
8. Header Structure:
   - [31 - 3] bit for size
   - [2] not used
   - [1] prev_alloc   : indicate whether or not previous block is allocated
   - [0] alloc        : indicate whether or current block is allocated
