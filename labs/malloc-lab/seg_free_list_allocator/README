This version used the segregated free list
Implementation Details
0. Possible Maximum allocate size: (1 << 31) - 1 Bytes
1. Free Block Organization: use segregated free list
2. Coalescing: use immediate coalescing with boundary tags
3. Placement:
   - first fit
   - best fit
4. Splitting: Splitting only if the size of the reminder would equal or exceed the minimum block size
5. Heap Structure
   [ free_list_arr | index_arr | [ 1 word padding | block 0 | block 1 | ... ]
6. Block Structure:
   - allocated block: [1 word Header | ... payload ... | optional padding ]
   - free block: [ 1 word header] | 1 word prev_pointer | 1 word next_pointer | .... | 1 word footer ]
7. Minimum block size: 16 bytes
8. Header Structure:
   - [31 - 3] bit for size
   - [2] not used
   - [1] prev_alloc   : indicate whether or not previous block is allocated
   - [0] alloc        : indicate whether or not current block is allocated
9. Size classes: power of 2
   - [16 ~ 31]
   - [32 ~ 63]
   - ...
   - [2^31 ~ (2^32)-1]
   - total: 28 classes
10. How to order free block in each list ?
   - choice 1 ordering by address
   - choice 2 LIFO
11. Analysis
   - malloc is linear to the size of one size class, worse case O(N)
   - free is linear to the size of one size class, if choose ordering by address, otherwise constant time
